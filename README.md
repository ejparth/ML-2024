**Day 1:** 3/14/2024 This folder entails ML algorithm which I used. I have also classified them as beginer to advanced. I will be updating the file as I will move.\
**Day 2:** 3/15/2024 Updated with Multivariable Linear Regression.\
**Day 3:** 3/16/2024 Swotted on Onehot Encoding - Used Cars name as one of the categories and used OHE to convert categorical data into numerical values.\
**Day 4:** 3/18/2024 Practiced train and test split method. used library of sklearn and used model selection. I also watched the video on Logistic Regression and solved some of the examples and excercise.\
**Day 5:** 3/19/2024 Practiced multivariate classification. solved Iris and digits dataset from sklearn library.\
**Day 6:** 3/20/2024 Went through Decision Tree and implemented decision tree classifier on Titanic data and Salary data. Used Label Encoding to convert catergorical data into numerical values.\
**Day 7:** 3/21/2024 Completed SVM implementation, went through the concept of hyperplane in ndimensions with maximum margins. Also, understood the concept of gamma and Regularization(C) the importance of Low regularisation and best gamma number. Used different kernels in the whole process like rbf, linear. Implemented all these concpets using sklearn library of svm with SVC classifier. Used datasets like iris and digits from model selection sklearn library.\
**Day 8:** 3/22/2024 Revised all the concepts that I implemented - One hot Encodeing, Label Encoder, mapping.. Classification, Regression etc. Also implemented Ensemble method using sklearn.ensemble library and used confusion metrics from sklearn.metrics library. Under ensemble used random forest method.\
**Day 9:** 3/23/2024 Tried my hands on with K Fold Validation technique used cross val score from sklearn.modelselection. Also completed Kmeans clustering with Elbow method. Created Matplotlib graph for Elbow method to determine the optimal number of K for the algorithm.\
**Day 10:** 3/24/2024 I have completed some parts of EDA and also how to more efficiently used pandas.\
**Day 11** 3/25/2024 Gone through Naive Bayes ML technique. implemented NB Gaussian on Titanic Data\
**Day 12** 3/26/2024 Completed Naive Bayes and HyperParameter Tuning.\
**Day 13** 3/27/2024 Comppleted KNN - K nearest neighbours is a classification model. Calculates the Elucedian distance between the k nearest points from the target point.\
**Day 14** 3/28/2024 Completed PCA - Principal Component Analysis. Main aim is select features which are higly important for training the mode.\
**Day 15** 3/29/2024 Used all feature extraction techiques, onehotencoding, KFold Cross Validation, GridSearchCV. Also learnt how to identify outliers and remove them from the data. Used IQR, SD technique and Eigen Values methods.
**Day 16** 3/30/2024 Created V.1 of Cheat sheet for Data Science. 
**Day 17** 3/31/2024 As I have completed most of the Algorithms in ML Classical. Spent my day auditing what I learnt for continous two weeks and also laid down plan for next month. I will be focussing on deploying the trained algos and after that will start with NLP.
